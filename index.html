        <p><h2 id="self-description">I'm a full stack web developer and so much more...</h2></p>
        <p id="description-explanation">Hi, my name is Lynde. It's nice to meet you. I am a full stack
        web developer, located in Gresham, Oregon. I became interested in programming several years ago when a
        co-worker of mine developed a really cool program that screened for and corrected human errors
        in our work. Unfortunately his idea wasn't well received by our IT department, but for the first
        time I saw the power behind programming and was fascinated. I left that job and for the last 8 years I have
        been a stay at home mom. When it was time for me to consider returning to work I dreaded the idea of doing
        what I was doing before. Don't get me wrong, there were many reasons why I loved doing what I had done
        previously, but the idea of starting over again felt demoralizing. That being said, starting a new career
        from scratch felt impossible. Balancing a family didn't leave me with much time for myself, but
        I couldn't get the idea of web development out of my head. After lots of research, I applied for
        and received a grant to help fund some technology training and I haven't looked back since. Learning
        to program hasn't been easy, and I still have a lot to learn, but I love it. It's challenging, it's
        rewarding, and it's limitless.</p>
        <p id="explanation2">Outside of web development, I am a mom to three awesome kids. I am married to my best friend,
        and I have a dog named Drexler. I love to travel and practice my Spanish. I am an avid camper and have
        never had a summer without at least a few camping trips. I love to be on or in the water and enjoy
        paddle boarding immensely. I am very connected to my community, and volunteer in many capacaties when and
        where I can. Get in touch if you'd like to chat more. I'd love to talk! </p>

<div class="faq">
    <h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
    <h2 id="question">Q. Do you have a college degree?</h2>
    <p id="answer">A. I have completed junior level coursework at Portland State with my
    major aimed toward Business Administration. I am currently a student at PDX Code Guild where
    I am expected to graduate in early June. I have 8 years of professional work experience in
    an administrative and leadership capacity, and 4 additional years in customer service.</p>
    <h2 id="question">Q. What are your life goals?</h2>
    <p id="answer">A. When it's all said and done I want to be able to have made a positive
    impact on my community. I want to have raised my three kids to be kind, hard working, independent adults.
    I want to have mastered at least one other language, maybe two (Spanish first, then German). I want to do a
    lot of travelling and one day retire in Central America. And most importantly, I want those around
    me to know without a doubt that I love them.</p>
    <h2 id="question">Q. What are your interests or hobbies?</h2>
    <p id="answer">A. My life revolves around my kids. I am heavily involved in the PTA, I am the team
    parent for every sport they play, and I am always hosting playdates. Outside of my kids, I love to
    be outdoors. I camp year round, regardless of the weather. But summer is my favorite season, as I am a
    water junkie. On any given day you are likely to find me in the water, either floating down
    the Clackamas, paddle boarding on Lake Merwin, or floating on an air mattress in the kiddy pool in my
    backyard. I also love to travel, and make it a point to visit a foreign country at least once a year.</p>
